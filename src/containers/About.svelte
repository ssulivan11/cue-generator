  <h1>â˜• About</h1>

  <p>
    A CUE file is a text file that defines the way tracks are organized on
    compact discs and super-audio CDs (SACDs).
  </p>

  <p>
    It may contain the song name, performer, and length of each track on the
    disc. CUE files are written in a standard format and therefore are
    recognized by most CD playback and editing programs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Please use these tools for good and support artists to the best of your
    ability.
